# Aperture Web (MVP portal SPA)

The TypeScript single-page app for the Aperture MVP portal — a config-driven, schema-derived
data explorer over a Hippo (LinkML + GraphQL) endpoint. Stack per **ADR-0030**: Vite + React +
TypeScript, urql (GraphQL), TanStack Table, nuqs. Talks to Hippo's GraphQL **directly**
(ADR-0014/0016).

> **Phase 1 — read loop (built).** On top of the Phase-0 walking skeleton (introspect →
> negotiate capabilities → schema-derived nav + table), the app now has equality facets + FTS
> derived from the endpoint's filter surface, an entity detail view with cross-links,
> relationship pivot and change history, and CSV/JSON export of the filtered set. The full
> query state `{collection, page, q, filters, entity}` lives in the URL. See
> `../design/implementation-plan.md` for the phased build and `../design/design-export/` +
> `../design/design-tokens.md` for the visual target.

## Getting started

```bash
cd web
npm install
VITE_HIPPO_GRAPHQL_URL=http://localhost:8000/graphql npm run dev
```

`VITE_HIPPO_GRAPHQL_URL` points at a running Hippo GraphQL endpoint (`hippo serve` with the
graphql extra). Without it the app starts in an honest "no endpoint configured" state. You can
also put the variable in an untracked `web/.env.local`.

## Scripts

| Script | What |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server |
| `npm run build` | typecheck (`tsc -b`) + production build |
| `npm run preview` | preview the production build |
| `npm run test` | run unit tests once (Vitest + Testing Library) |
| `npm run test:watch` | tests in watch mode |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc -b --noEmit` |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run format` | Prettier write |

CI runs typecheck + lint + test + build on changes under `web/` (`.github/workflows/web.yml`).

## Notes

- **Design tokens** live in `src/styles/tokens.css`, extracted from the Claude Design export.
  A dark theme (`[data-theme='dark']`) is a follow-on.
- **Fonts:** IBM Plex Sans/Mono are self-hosted via `@fontsource` imports in `main.tsx`
  (the design export loaded them from Google Fonts — not carried over).
- **Capabilities are negotiated, never faked (ADR-0029):** every flag derives from what the
  endpoint's introspection actually advertises. Sort/aggregation stay off until Hippo X1 lands;
  the pager hides entirely when offset pagination isn't advertised.
- **Hippo enrichment:** `hippoSchema` presence is detected as a capability; the richer
  enrichment query (slot kinds beyond GraphQL types) is a Phase-1 follow-on to confirm against
  a live `hippo serve`.
- **Sort + facet counts:** deliberately absent until Hippo X1 (aggregation) advertises them —
  the UI never fakes a count or a server sort (ADR-0029).
- **External xrefs:** `src/config/xrefs.ts` maps field names to URL templates per deployment;
  empty by default.
- **Next:** Phase 2 — the write loop (Tier-0 schema-derived forms); see issue #7.
