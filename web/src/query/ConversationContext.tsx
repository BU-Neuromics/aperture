 * turn is being edited, whether a request is in flight) stay in `ChatPanel`,
 * because nothing outside it has any business reading them.
 *
 * The builder lock is the reason this exists (ADR-0039, design Decision 11):
 * Mosaic's `converse_query_spec` asserts that the wire `query_spec` agrees with
 * what it derives from `turns`, and 400s when they disagree. So once a
 * conversation owns the spec, hand-editing it is a correctness problem, not a
 * taste one — only the *presentation* of the lock is a design choice.
