# Prefab — Data Stories → moved to Reel

The keystone probe — a NotebookLM-style conversational exploration of Hippo metadata, the cheapest
decisive test of *"can an LLM reliably drive a typed declarative artifact through a validator to a
correct change?"* — is now **Reel's** keystone, not Aperture's. Aperture is the **rendering
portal** that consumes the View Contract instances such a story produces.

The portal-era prefab walkthrough (`core-loop.md`, the two-tier ladder) that the *portal* config
engine must reproduce stays here in Aperture's `prefab/`.
