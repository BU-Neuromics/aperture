## Context

`vision.md` (2026-06-17) replaced the product framing: Aperture is an **AI-native interaction
layer** over the BASS domain graph, not a rendered config-driven portal (the portal is its
substrate/MVP). But the application-architecture decision (ADR-0014) still asks the *portal*
question — "server-rendered vs. client-side **app shell**" — as though a rendered UI is the
product. It is not: the near-term agent surface is an **external MCP coding agent** with no
Aperture UI at all (ADR-0021), and the UI, when it exists, is a *renderer over the
instruction-path model* (ADR-0022), one of five admitted modes.

Two further forces converge on the same point:

1. **The design already separates "what to show" from "how to paint it."** Components and views
   emit serializable **view-descriptions**, never DOM (ADR-0009); the data reach is an
   **injected** capability-scoped client (ADR-0008); the config/state store is a **port** with a
   reference impl, not a hard dependency (ADR-0017). These are exactly the seams a framework- and
   shell-agnostic core needs.
2. **Embeddability is a requirement (2026-06-22).** Aperture should be embeddable in a larger
   host app, with **no specific host named** — i.e. embeddability must be a *property of the
   architecture*, not a one-off integration. The granularity chosen is **headless core + thin
   shell** (a host mounts the core and supplies/overrides the shell), the SDK-first principle
   (root `CLAUDE.md`) extended up to the UI layer.

The question this ADR settles is therefore **not** "SSR vs SPA" — it is **what is the product
unit, and where is the boundary between reusable core and replaceable shell.** Get this wrong and
the framework choice (ADR-0011/0014) becomes a load-bearing, hard-to-reverse bet; get it right and
that choice collapses to "which default shell," low-stakes and swappable.

## Decision

**Aperture is a framework-agnostic, headless *interaction core* plus a thin, replaceable
*shell*. The product is the core; the shipped application is one ordinary consumer of it.**

**The headless core** (no DOM, no framework, pure TypeScript) owns all interaction logic:

- the **instruction-path engine** — `state[n] = apply(instruction[n], state[n-1])` over the typed
  op catalog (ADR-0022/0024), deterministic and as-of-pinned (ADR-0023);
- the **view-description types + headless validators** (ADR-0009/0010) — the engine's output is
  serializable descriptions, never pixels;
- the **component runtime** (ADR-0011) — Web Worker, view-spec-emitting;
- the **data-plane source adapter** behind the **injected capability-scoped client** (ADR-0008/0017);
- the **control-plane store port** (ADR-0017) — config, user state, and `DataStory` persistence;
- the **agent surface** (MCP/API, ADR-0021).

**The shell** is the only part that touches a UI framework: it realizes view-descriptions into
pixels and owns layout, routing, navigation, and theming. The Aperture-shipped shell is *a*
shell, not *the* product.

**Embeddability is then a property, delivered by three injection seams the host fills** — none
new, each already a decision:

1. **The capability-scoped client (ADR-0008)** — the host injects auth/data access; Aperture
   stays auth-unaware.
2. **The control-plane store port (ADR-0017)** — the host may supply config/state persistence, or
   accept the LinkML-on-Hippo reference impl.
3. **The renderer/shell** — the host either mounts Aperture's default shell as a component or
   consumes view-descriptions and renders them in its own shell (down to a single `DataStory` or
   view artifact).

A host embeds Aperture by filling these seams; the default app fills them with defaults. There is
**one** core, exercised identically whether driven by the shipped shell, an embedding host, the
MCP agent, or the headless validators.

## Consequences

- **ADR-0014 is reframed, not answered as posed.** "SSR vs SPA vs hybrid" is no longer the
  product architecture — it is a **delivery option for the default shell**. SSR, SPA, embedded
  widget, and "headless, host renders" all become *consumers of the same core*. ADR-0014 should be
  superseded/rewritten to record this (the next ADR), and the framework-selection question it
  defers (now lower-stakes) gets its own ADR.
- **The framework choice is demoted from keystone to shell detail.** Because the core is
  framework-agnostic, picking React/Svelte/web-components for the default shell does not bind the
  product; a host on a different stack still consumes the core. Strongly favors shipping the
  renderer as framework-neutral (e.g. web components) so embedding doesn't require the host adopt
  Aperture's framework — to be settled in the framework ADR.
- **New invariant: no interaction logic in the shell.** Anything that decides *what* to show
  (instruction ops, state reduction, binding, validation) lives in the core; the shell only
  decides *how to paint* a view-description. Logic leaking into the shell is the signal the core
  boundary has drifted — the UI-layer analogue of ADR-0002's domain-noun grep.
- **Headlessness is enforced, not aspirational.** The same view-description→validation path that
  ADR-0009 already requires (Node/Web Worker, no browser) *is* the core's public surface, so "the
  core runs with no shell" is checked by the existing headless tests, not a separate effort.
- **Theming/design-tokens become an explicit seam** so an embedded Aperture can inherit a host's
  look — a follow-on for the shell/framework ADR.
- **SDK-first stays consistent across the stack** (root `CLAUDE.md`): business logic in a typed
  core, transport/render as thin wrappers — now true on the frontend, not just Python/REST.

## Alternatives considered

- **Answer ADR-0014 as posed (pick SSR or SPA for "the app").** Treats a rendered shell as the
  product — the portal-era framing `vision.md` retired. It also makes the framework choice
  load-bearing and forecloses embedding. Rejected: it answers a question we no longer ask.
- **Embed by shipping a self-contained app the host iframes.** Strong isolation, but weak
  integration (styling, deep state/selection sharing, auth handoff) and it doesn't make the
  *engine* reusable — the host gets a black box, not a core. Kept as one *shell delivery option*
  (for cross-stack third-party hosts), not the architecture.
- **Micro-frontend (module federation) as the embedding model.** Heaviest infra, couples host and
  Aperture build tooling, and still needs the core/shell split underneath to be worth it.
  Rejected as the baseline; admissible later as a shell delivery option if a host demands it.
- **Headless SDK only, no shipped shell.** Maximally flexible but ships nothing usable and starves
  the keystone probe (which needs a running surface). Rejected: ship a default shell *as a
  consumer*, don't omit it.

## Notes / open sub-questions

- **Does not depend on the ADR-0010 vocabulary probe.** The core/shell boundary holds whatever the
  primitive catalog turns out to be; the probe only sizes the *renderer's* primitive set, inside
  the shell. So this ADR can ratify ahead of the keystone — and it *removes* the framework choice
  from the keystone's critical path.
- The exact **core public API** (how a host obtains and drives an instruction-path session, mounts
  a renderer, and injects the three seams) is a follow-on design once this boundary is accepted.
- Boundary of "thin": is the framework-neutral **view-description renderer** part of the core
  (framework-agnostic, e.g. web components) or part of the shell? Leaning: the renderer is a
  framework-neutral core artifact; the *shell* is only routing/nav/layout/theming. Settle in the
  framework ADR.
- Relationship to the **default control-plane**: embedding hosts that decline LinkML-on-Hippo need
  the store port surface specified (ADR-0017 says "port, not dependency" — this makes a host the
  first non-Hippo consumer to pressure-test it).
